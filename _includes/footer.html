            Apache Pegasus is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF),
            sponsored by the Apache Incubator. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects
            until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process
            have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is
            not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the
            project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
