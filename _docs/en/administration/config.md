# Configuration components

The configuration of Pegasus is in ini format, which mainly consists of the following components:

* core: The configurations are related to the runtime of a Pegasus Service kernel engine.
* network: The configurations are related to the RPC component.
* Thread pools: The configurations are for each thread pool in the Pegasus Service.
* appï¼š`app` is a concept in rDSN that can be understood as a _component_ or _job_ in a distributed system. For example, MetaServer and ReplicaServer in Pegasus are each apps. Multiple apps can be launched within a process, and for each app, its behavior can be configured separately, such as name, port, thread pool, etc.
* task: Task is also a concept in rDSN, which can be understood as _asynchronous task_. For example, an RPC asynchronous call, an asynchronous file IO operation, or a timer event are all tasks. Each task has a unique name defined. For each task, its behavior can be configured, such as trace, profiler, etc.
* Consistency protocol: Configurations are related to consistency replication protocol.
* RocksDB: The configurations of RocksDB that Pegasus uses.
* Others: The configurations of other modules in Pegasus, such as logging, monitoring, Zookeeper configuration, etc.

The configuration file involves some rDSN concepts. For further understanding of these concepts, please refer to the [rDSN project](https://github.com/XiaoMi/rdsn).

Below is a partial explanation of the Pegasus configuration file. Some of these configuration items are common to clients, such as `app`, `task`, `threadpool`, etc., while others are unique to the server side. To understand the true meaning of these configurations, it is recommended to first read the [PacificA paper](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/pacifica-replication-in-log-based-distributed-storage-systems/) and have a clear understanding of the rDSN project and Pegasus architecture.

# Configuration suggestions

* It is recommended to use IP addresses for all items in the configuration file that require the use of server addresses.
* It is recommended to use default values for most configuration items.
* You can change the configuration values as needed only if you understand the meaning and impact of configuration items.
* For further understanding of configuration items, please refer to the source code.
